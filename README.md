# Go-Ride
## About
People all over travel great distances to gatherings in other cities, or even shorter distances from surrounding neighbourhoods to universities. A system would be needed in this situation to advertise available lifts and to also advertise lifts needed. The objective of the carpooling system is to provide an easy means to find people with whom to travel to an event or recurring activity, reduce traffic loads during peak times, and lower the carbon emission levels per person per car. Uber is a system that exists and is similar to our system, but Uber is city based and does not allow for lifts from one city to another. E.g. going from PE to Cape Town for a concert.

@effleurager worked on the backend and @KinkyRobot and I worked on the frontend. For this project, we had to also do a requirements and an elaboration document before starting to implement our system. Due to the fees must fall, in 2016, we were informed near the end of the year that we only had to have two use cases implemented per team member. When we found this out we were actually done with roughly 16 of our use cases, since we had continued working on the project through the protests. @effleurager and I decided to continue working, on the project, to try and complete the whole system.
